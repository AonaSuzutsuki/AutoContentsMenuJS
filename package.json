  "description": "Automatically generate a table of contents for the headings (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 tags) by hierarchy using JavaScript. Tables of contents are often created by hand. However, as the size of the table of contents increases, it becomes difficult to keep the table of contents consistent when changing the display name, position, or ID of the headings. This script reduces the burden of document creation by automatically generating a table of contents by calling a method in JavaScript. The main feature of this script is that the table of contents can be divided into different groups. This makes it possible to describe multiple topics on a single page.",
